##### Salt hay culture in transition

Commentaries of urban observers indicate that hay packed into rectilinear bales, brought to cities by rail from distant markets, played a large role in diminishing demand for locally-harvested heaps of salt hay. “It is so much more convenient for stablemen to receive hay in bales that comparatively few of them buy loose hay," a Newark newspaper columnist wrote in 1880. “…New Jersey farmers, feeling the competition, now raise produce rather than hay.”

Cognizant of the ease with which the hay was moved from train to stable, the unnamed author gave significant causal credo to the new convenience of the stackable hay. In the columnist’s view, the square bales streaming into the New Jersey-New York area from more far-flung locales were “the principal cause for the decline of the [Newark] hay trade.” Further, the columnist declared that the custom of selling hay at Newark’s Hay Market was no longer being upheld.

> "There is an ordinance which says that ‘no person having hay, straw or wood for sale by the load or otherwise, from any wagon shall top or wait for a purchaser in any street, highway, public land or alley or any public ground than at the corner of Summer and Seventh avenue, known as the Hay Market.’ And yet there are probably more loads of hay sold in the city outside the hay market than within it. The owners sell them coming down Springfield avenue or coming up Frelinghuysen avenue from Union County, and once in a while some farmer who is venturesome or does not know the law halts his load of hay in front of the First Presbyterian church and creates a temporary market there," he opined.
