##### Salt hay culture in transition

Commentaries of urban observers indicate that hay packed into rectilinear bales, brought to cities by rail from distant markets, played a large role in diminishing demand for locally-harvested heaps of salt hay. “It is so much more convenient for stablemen to receive hay in bales that comparatively few of them buy loose hay," a Newark newspaper columnist wrote in 1880. “…New Jersey farmers, feeling the competition, now raise produce rather than hay.”

Cognizant of the ease with which the hay was moved from train to stable, the unnamed author gave significant causal credo to the new convenience of the stackable hay. In the columnist’s view, the square bales streaming into the New Jersey-New York area from more far-flung locales were “the principal cause for the decline of the [Newark] hay trade.” Further, the columnist declared that the custom of selling hay at Newark’s Hay Market was no longer being upheld.

> "There is an ordinance which says that ‘no person having hay, straw or wood for sale by the load or otherwise, from any wagon shall top or wait for a purchaser in any street, highway, public land or alley or any public ground than at the corner of Summer and Seventh avenue, known as the Hay Market.’ And yet there are probably more loads of hay sold in the city outside the hay market than within it. The owners sell them coming down Springfield avenue or coming up Frelinghuysen avenue from Union County, and once in a while some farmer who is venturesome or does not know the law halts his load of hay in front of the First Presbyterian church and creates a temporary market there," he opined.

After the creation of the Region of Greater New York in 1898, the city finalized plans for the Queensborough Bridge (or 59th Street Bridge) in 1901. “The Lone Tenement” that appears here was likely constructed from brick forged in nearby meadows. Bellows painted this canvas as the bridge was being prepared for its opening in 1909, while he was living in a studio nearby, on 66th Street. The view captured in the painting faces east from Manhattan towards salt meadows and refineries in Queens. A steamship travels south on the East River, and people warm themselves by a fire in the foreground. A horse and buggy takes an alternate path towards an area of waterfront that appears to be in the process of being filled, post-bridge construction. From left to right, two bare trees, the brick tenement, and the cast-concrete bridge footings support a steel deck. Together they register three material phases in the construction of the city: wood, brick, concrete and steel. The band of meadows on the horizon, the land in the process of being filled in the middle ground and, and the filled land in the foreground register three interconnected phases of landscape change.
