It concludes, \"He has allowed these ample Prices, that no further delay may be made by the Farmers in bringing in all the Hay they have, both Fresh and Salt, to the most contiguous Magazines, where they will receive Certificates for the Quantity delivered, which will be Paid at the Forage Office in New-York, and has directed me to acquaint them, that any Person that is found Delinquent after this Notice, will have their Forage taken, and no Receipts given.\" In other words. farmers were given the choice of selling all their hay to the British Army for bargain prices--or having it confiscated for no price at all. The printer of this broadside is not named, but all other official New York imprints recorded by Evans for 1778 were printed by Rivington. Not in Evans or ESTC, and apparently unrecorded.
