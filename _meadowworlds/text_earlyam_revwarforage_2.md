description_from_holding_institution: A previously unknown broadside demonstrating
  the heavy-handed tactics of the British in New York. "The Commander in Chief having
  taken into consideration the Price of Forage, does not think it adequate to other
  Articles, and is pleased to Order, that from and after the above Date, the following
  prices should be Paid until further Orders." Prices are given for upland hay, salt
  hay, straw, Indian corn, and oats plus the cost of carting. It concludes, "He has
  allowed these ample Prices, that no further delay may be made by the Farmers in
  bringing in all the Hay they have, both Fresh and Salt, to the most contiguous Magazines,
  where they will receive Certificates for the Quantity delivered, which will be Paid
  at the Forage Office in New-York, and has directed me to acquaint them, that any
  Person that is found Delinquent after this Notice, will have their Forage taken,
  and no Receipts given." In other words. farmers were given the choice of selling
  all their hay to the British Army for bargain prices--or having it confiscated for
  no price at all. The printer of this broadside is not named, but all other official
  New York imprints recorded by Evans for 1778 were printed by Rivington. Not in Evans
  or ESTC, and apparently unrecorded. [Swann Galleries, Printed & Manuscript Americana,
