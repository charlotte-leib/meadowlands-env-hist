notes: Having had my Salt-Marsh over-flowed and rendered useless by the "Experiments"
  of Mr. Nathan Read, lately proposed as a suitable person to send on to Congress,
  and a number of my neighbours being in the same predicament, we are determined not
  to give him our votes; as we consider a man who is an enemy to Salt-Hay, can be
  no friend of Farmers, or their concerns. As I have not the same complaint to make
  of Col. William R. Lee, of Marblehead, he shall have my vote and influence. A FARMER.
  Danvers, August 16, 1800.
