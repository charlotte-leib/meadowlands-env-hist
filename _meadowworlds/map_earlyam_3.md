description_from_holding_institution: This beautifully engraved and colored map represents
  an English version of the Jansson-Visscher series of maps of northeastern North
  America. Since it was published shortly after the expulsion of the Dutch from New
  York, the map displays geographical features similar to those found on its Dutch
  counterparts. However, the place names New Netherlands and New Amsterdam have been
  rechristened New York reflecting British control of the former Dutch colony. This
  map appeared in Thomas Basset and Richard Chiswell's 1676 edition of John Speed's
  world atlas, first published in 1627.
