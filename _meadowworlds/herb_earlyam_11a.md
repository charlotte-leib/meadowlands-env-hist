notes: Scotch Broom plant is closely related to the Spanish Broom (Spartium junceum).
  "Spartine" cord, also known as "Spartan rope" or "Laconian rope," refers to a type
  of rope made from the fibers of the Spartium plant, commonly known as Spanish broom
  or weaver's broom. Spartium is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region,
  including Greece. The Spartans, renowned for their military prowess and resourcefulness,
  utilized Spartine cord for various purposes, including crafting of nets, ropes,
  and even parts of their armor. The Spartium plant's fibers were strong and flexible,
  making them suitable for such applications. Spartan rope was prized for its durability
  and strength and was highly valued in ancient warfare.
